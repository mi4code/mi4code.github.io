*it supports DDC/CI so you can control brightness from connected PC with software like Monitorian (i recomend to change the setting as is in the picture)*

![TODO image]()
*in case you dont want to waste USB for touch on platforms like Raspberry Pi you can connect it via I2C (the chip is GT9110, setup guide <https://gist.github.com/io4nn1s/20137898885209589e3f3bcff81453b4#file-gt9110_overlay-dts-L6> - for testing purposes you can ommit RST pin)*
